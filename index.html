                <p>
                    My name is Christian Joseph and I am currently learning how to code. A little back story about me, I am 29 years old and live in Union, New Jersey. I have recently begun teaching myself how to code. 
                    I have always had an interest in coding, but figured that it was something that you need to learn from young to be successful. Since a child, I always wanted to be an inventor or scientist. 
                    This was due in large part to my childhood favorite show Dexter's Laboratory. Ever since I have been into science and technology. For me, learning how to code is more than just landing a cool job making good money. 
                    I have this childlike spark and passion for it and I have realized that this is due to my childhood dream. In a way, being a Programmer is a lot like being an inventor and scientist. 
                    I owe it to myself to give this my best shot at achieving my childhood dream.
